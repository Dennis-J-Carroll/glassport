"""Agent-facing advisory: render glassport findings into a markdown block
suitable for an agent-instruction file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md).

Load-bearing invariant: the output lands in an instruction surface, so this
module renders from STRUCTURED fields only and never consumes the free-text
Annotation.explanation / Finding.detail (which embed attacker-controlled
tool names, hosts, and matched source). The few attacker-controlled values
that are surfaced (host, tool, path) pass through _sanitize_inline first.
